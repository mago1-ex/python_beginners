If all of the elements are `True`, the expression is `True`, and the last value, which must also be `True`, is returned. \n",
    "The converse is true for `or`; only one `True` element makes the statement logically `True`, and the first `True` value found is returned. If no `True` values are found, the last (`False`) value is returned. In other words, as with many other languages, evaluation stops as soon as a true expression is found for the or operator or as soon as a false expression is found for the and operator: "
